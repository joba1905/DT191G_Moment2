    "Year": "2004",
    "Description": "In August 2004, the precursor to Svartsot was founded in Randers, Denmark, playing folk-influenced black metal. The band went under various names, finally settling on Skoll (the name of the wolf in Nordic myth who pursued the sun, before finally swallowing it). The word “svartsot”, meaning “black sickness” in older Danish, was introduced to the band in late 2004, and was considered as a possible theme for a lyric. At that time no one in the band knew exactly which disease the word referred to, but after some research it was found to be an obsolete name for a liver disorder similar to jaundice. At some time in very early 2005, the band began discussing changing the name to Svartsot as people were confusing Skoll with the English word “skull”."

    "Year": "1984",
    "Description": "Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed in Langhus in 1984. They were one of the founders of the Norwegian black metal scene and their music has strongly influenced the black metal genre. Mayhem's early career was highly controversial, primarily due to their notorious live performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist Øystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\") of Burzum.  The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the incidents of violence surrounding them."
